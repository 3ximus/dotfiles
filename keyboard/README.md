# Keyboard firmware compiler

For the corne firmware just edit the file and run the `./flash-corne.sh` script

For the klor you must have this fork of the klor firmware https://github.com/GEIGEIGEIST/qmk-config-klor/pull/17
until it's merged or pushed upstream to qmk. Then just run the scrip `./flash-klor.sh`
